# ontology_metrics_toolkit
Ontology Metrics Toolkit is a Python tool for analyzing RDF/OWL ontologies, focusing on Turtle (.ttl) files. It identifies classes, individuals, and properties, calculates metrics like property density and subclass distribution, analyzes literals, and detects reused ontologies. Outputs metrics to Excel for easy analysis and ontology improvement.
